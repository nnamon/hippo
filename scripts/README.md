To replicate CI behavior locally:

```bash
# Run full CI suite
./scripts/run_tests.sh --all && ./scripts/security_check.sh

# Check coverage before pushing
./scripts/coverage_check.sh

# Debug specific test failures
./scripts/run_tests.sh --unit
docker run --rm -it hippo-test:latest pytest tests/test_content_manager.py -v
```
