# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Hippo is a Telegram bot that reminds users to drink water with cute cartoons and poems. The bot operates on user-configurable schedules and tracks hydration metrics to generate personalized cartoon states (6 hydration levels from dehydrated to fully engorged).

## Architecture

This is a Python-based Telegram bot project with the following core components:

- **User Management**: Handle Telegram user subscriptions and configuration
- **Scheduling System**: Support both interval-based (every 15 mins) and time-based (18th minute every hour) reminders
- **Hydration Tracking**: Persist user water drinking metrics and calculate hydration states
- **Content Generation**: Generate poems and select appropriate cartoon images based on hydration state
- **Cartoon Theming**: Support multiple cartoon sets with 6 states each, user-selectable themes

## Implementation Notes

- The project is implemented in Python 3.9+ using python-telegram-bot framework
- SQLite database for user data and hydration metrics persistence
- Cartoon images organized in themed arrays of 6 hydration states (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%)
- Bot uses async architecture with job queue for scheduled reminders
- Deployment via Docker containers on Digital Ocean

- Bot token obtained from @BotFather on Telegram
- Database file (`hippo.db`) created automatically on first run

## Debugging and Monitoring

### Database Debug Tools

The project includes comprehensive database debugging tools for troubleshooting and monitoring:

**Quick Debug (Recommended):**
```bash
make db-debug         # Comprehensive database analysis with Makefile
```

**Alternative Methods:**
```bash
./scripts/debug.sh    # Direct script execution

# Manual debug
DATABASE_PATH=./data/hippo.db python scripts/debug_database.py

# From inside Docker container (after rebuild)
docker exec hippo-water-bot python scripts/debug_database.py

# Interactive database shell
make db-shell         # Open SQLite shell with Makefile
```

**Debug Output Includes:**
- üóÑÔ∏è **Database Information**: File size, location, record counts
- üë• **User Details**: All registered users with settings and status
- üìä **User Statistics**: Success rates, event counts, last activity
- üåä **Hydration Levels**: Current hydration status for all users
- ‚è∞ **Active Reminders**: Outstanding reminders and expiration status
- üíß **Recent Events**: Last 50 hydration events (confirmed/missed)

**Use Cases:**
- Monitor bot health and user engagement
- Troubleshoot reminder delivery issues
- Analyze user hydration patterns
- Identify expired or stuck reminders
- Verify database persistence after container restarts

## Development Workflow

**CRITICAL: Always use feature branches and pull requests. NEVER commit directly to main.**

### Required Workflow (with Makefile)
1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/description-of-work`
2. **Implement changes** on the feature branch
3. **Write/update tests**: Add tests for new functionality or bug fixes
4. **Run validation**: `make validate` to run linting and all tests
5. **Test functionality**: Test the bot implementation manually as appropriate
6. **Commit changes** to feature branch with descriptive messages
7. **Push branch**: `git push -u origin feature/branch-name`
8. **Verify GitHub Actions**: Ensure all CI/CD checks pass (tests, coverage, security)
9. **Test with running bot**: Before creating a PR, ask the user to verify the changes work with the running bot
10. **Create Pull Request**: Use `gh pr create` with proper title and description ONLY after user confirms the implementation works
11. **Review coverage comments**: Address any coverage concerns in the automated PR comment
12. **Only merge** after review/approval and all checks passing

### Alternative Workflow (Traditional)
1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/description-of-work`
2. **Implement changes** on the feature branch
3. **Write/update tests**: Add tests for new functionality or bug fixes
4. **Run Docker tests**: `./scripts/run_tests.sh` to verify everything works
5. **Test functionality**: Test the bot implementation manually as appropriate
6. **Commit changes** to feature branch with descriptive messages
7. **Push branch**: `git push -u origin feature/branch-name`
8. **Verify GitHub Actions**: Ensure all CI/CD checks pass (tests, coverage, security)
9. **Test with running bot**: Before creating a PR, ask the user to verify the changes work with the running bot
10. **Create Pull Request**: Use `gh pr create` with proper title and description ONLY after user confirms the implementation works
11. **Review coverage comments**: Address any coverage concerns in the automated PR comment
12. **Only merge** after review/approval and all checks passing

### Important Development Practices

#### Commit Frequently
**Save progress often with commits** to enable easy rollback of changes:
- Commit working states before making major changes
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed
- This allows you to revert to a known-good state if something breaks
- Example: `git commit -m "Add user hydration tracking before refactoring reminder system"`

#### Test-Driven Development
**IMPORTANT: Always include tests when adding new functionality**:
- Write tests for new features alongside implementation
- Use existing test patterns in `tests/` directory as templates
- Ensure new code maintains or improves overall coverage
- Run tests locally before pushing: `make test` (recommended) or `./scripts/run_tests.sh`
- Use `make quick-test` for rapid feedback during development
- Use `make test-coverage` to verify coverage improvements

#### Debugging Failed Tests
**When GitHub Actions fail (Makefile approach)**:
1. **Check the PR comment**: Automatic coverage analysis identifies issues
2. **Run tests locally**: `make test` or `make ci-test` to reproduce issues
3. **Quick debugging**: `make quick-test` for fast feedback
4. **View detailed logs**: Use `gh run view --log-failed` for GitHub Actions logs
5. **Test specific components**: `make test-unit` or `make test-integration`
6. **Generate coverage report**: `make test-coverage` for detailed analysis

**Traditional approach**:
1. **Check the PR comment**: Automatic coverage analysis identifies issues
2. **Run tests locally**: `./scripts/run_tests.sh` to reproduce issues
3. **View detailed logs**: Use `gh run view --log-failed` for GitHub Actions logs
4. **Test in Docker**: `docker run --rm hippo-test` to match CI environment
5. **Test specific components**: `./scripts/run_tests.sh --unit` or `./scripts/run_tests.sh --integration`

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates

## MCP Tools Note

- The MCP Puppeteer tool runs inside a Docker container
- When accessing local services with Puppeteer, use `http://host.docker.internal:PORT` instead of `http://localhost:PORT`
- This allows the Docker container to access the host machine's services
